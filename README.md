# React + TypeScript + Vite

Project for the COSTA team at VGCS

To run:

- npm i
- npm run dev

(also start the mockoon server at port 1337 with the given enviroment.)

Mockoon import not working since they removed the feature to use their native import/export.

Had to downgrade to Mockoon 1.15.0 using chocolatey to import .json to avoid altering.
